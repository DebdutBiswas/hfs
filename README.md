(this project is currently at a very early stage, and thus not useful yet)

HTTP File Server

It's a file server offering a powerful virtual file system (vfs).
Thanks to the vfs you don't need to expose a whole folder, but just a single file.
Or you can change the name of files. Or many other things, without really touching the stuff on your hard disk.
Both file browsing and back-end administration are performed through a web browser.
