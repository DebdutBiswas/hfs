=== DOING
bug: backend.js: add could be a restore
bug: restoring a deleted items creates a virtual folder instead                            
backend: vfs: think of a good way to report removed items
    * show them as "ghost" items (cons: takes a lot of space)
    * show them in the properties of the folder (cons: you have to open properties) 
    * show a single item "removed elements", similar to a folder, collapsed by default
bug: when a dynamic item is deleted, then readded, it should be treated properly 
debugging console via telnet (still working very bad) 
improve in-source documentation

backend: vfs: overlay icon to signalise temp nodes (based on nodeKind)

vfs permissions
backend: vfs: drag&drop
handle non-working IO connection for both frontend and backend
? coffee-script
what wiki to use for development, github or rejetto.com?
