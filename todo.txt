=== DOING
it's like there's a memory leak. See section below for tests already made. 
debugging console via telnet (still working very bad) 
improve in-source documentation
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc

=== NEXT
backend: vfs: specific icon for the "deleted" folder
backend: vfs: overlay icon to signalise temp nodes (based on nodeKind) 

=== AFTER
?comply with standard callback(err,data)
make the .expansion-button a fixed size
? folder multi-bind
    ? if 2 binds have 2 subfolders with same name, should merge them too? 
vfs permissions
backend: vfs: drag&drop
zip stream
handle non-working IO connection for both frontend and backend
? coffee-script
what wiki to use for development, github or rejetto.com?
modules that could be useful
    for better performance on socket.io exchanges https://github.com/pgriess/node-msgpack
    mime https://github.com/bentomas/node-mime
    most used reloader https://github.com/remy/nodemon
    browse the whole list at https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules

=== SHOULD I SWITCH TO PYTHON 3?
now tornado supports python3. Reconsider.
    PROS
    - (?) wider programmers community
    - more libraries (sure? libs need to be async, don't they? so, they may even be fewer)
    CONS
    - have to port what's already written

=== MEMORY LEAK
having a refresh at 1Hz
    both frontend and backend
