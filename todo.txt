=== DOING
improve in-source documentation
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc

=== NEXT
benchmark on mobile: measure the time it takes to enter a folder, and then show it with an alert
save vfs to file (yml)
backend: overlapped node are not displayed (fixed's and mod's overlapping temp's)

=== AFTER
? sockjs
? comply with standard callback(err,data)
? folder multi-bind
    ? if 2 binds have 2 subfolders with same name, should merge them too? 
vfs permissions
backend: vfs: drag&drop
zip stream
handle non-working IO connection for both frontend and backend
? coffee-script
what wiki to use for development, github or rejetto.com?

=== SHOULD I SWITCH TO PYTHON 3?
now tornado supports python3. Reconsider.
    PROS
    - wider programmers community
    - more libraries (sure? libs need to be async, don't they? so, they may even be fewer)
    CONS
    - have to port the whole server part
