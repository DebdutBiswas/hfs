backend: vfs: key navigation: the selected element is always visible and other improvements 


=== DOING
debugging console via telnet (still working very bad) 
improve in-source documentation
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc

=== NEXT
backend: vfs: think of a good way to report removed items
    * show them as "ghost" items
    * show them in the properties of the folder
    * show a single item "removed elements", similar to a folder, collapsed by default                      
backend: vfs: overlay icon to signalise temp nodes (based on nodeKind) 
backend: rename expand-button in expansion-button

=== AFTER
bug: backend: vfs: items with existing name shouldn't be allowed (e.g. add same virtual folder twice)
bug: backend: vfs: if i delete too fast, selection is lost 
make the .expansion-button a fixed size
? folder multi-bind
    ? if 2 binds have 2 subfolders with same name, should merge them too? 
vfs permissions
backend: vfs: drag&drop
handle non-working IO connection for both frontend and backend
? coffee-script
what wiki to use for development, github or rejetto.com?
ensure the web apps are perfectly working offline, don't rely on online resources (or do it just as an option or gracefully degrade)
