bugfix: backend: vfs: rename on temp nodes went lost

=== DOING
debugging console via telnet (still working very bad) 
improve in-source documentation
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc
    
=== NEXT
backend: vfs: key navigation: ensure the selected element is visible 
backend: vfs: remove
    think of a good way to report removed items
        * show them as "ghost" items
        * show them in the properties of the folder                  
backend: vfs: overlay icon to signalise temp nodes (based on nodeKind) 
backend: rename expand-button in expansion-button

=== AFTER
make the .expansion-button a fixed size
? folder multi-bind
vfs permissions
backend: vfs: drag&drop
handle non-working IO connection for both frontend and backend
? coffee-script
what wiki to use for development, github or rejetto.com?
ensure the web apps are perfectly working offline, don't rely on online resources (or do it just as an option or gracefully degrade)
